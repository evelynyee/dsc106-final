                <li>How this plot adds to the story: 
                    It will introduce the languages and etymological relationships presented in the dataset. 
                    This should prepare the viewers for the other, more impactful visuals.

                <li>How this plot adds to the story: 
                    This plot will directly demonstrate which languages English terms show the most etymological relationships with. 
                    This will demonstrate the global relationship between different languages and emphasize the main idea of my project - that languages are deeply connected.

                <li>How this plot adds to the story: 
                    <br>This will allow users to explore the etymological data for any term they want to investigate. 
                    <br>This network-style visual will provide more details for a specific term and its connected terms, 
                    <br>whereas the previous visualizations are more general and language-level. 
                    <br>In contrast, this visual will allow the user to do self-guided exploration of the data at a term-level.

        (With my project, I want to challenge notions of national differences and language-based xenophobia, and I especially want to emphasize the way that language is constantly changing through rich cultural exchange.
        Additionally, I hope to bring some attention to linguistics and present etymology as something interesting and accessible for people to engage with.

                (I hope people become more curious/aware of the words they use in daily life, which they often take for granted. 
                I also hope people leave with a greater appreciation of the global, changing nature of our language.)</li>
