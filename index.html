        <h1>Etymology - The Ways our Languages Speak to Eachother</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="intro">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> 
            According to Merriam-Webster's dictionary, 
            <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/etymology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etymology</a>
            is 
            <em>"the history of a linguistic form (such as a word) shown by tracing its development since its earliest recorded occurrence 
                in the language where it is found, by tracing its transmission from one language to another, by analyzing it into its 
                component parts, by identifying its cognates in other languages, or by tracing it and its cognates to a common ancestral 
                form in an ancestral language."
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>But what does that mean, really?</p>
        <p>
            Essentially, etymology is the study of words.
            More specifically, a word's etymology tells its history, like a biography tells the history of a person. 
            Whether you realize it or not, every word on this page, like every person you see on the street, has a rich history that we 
            all too often take for granted. After all, most words weren’t just invented one day - many have a rich web of connections 
            to other words.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, “geometry,” “geography,” and “geoJSON” all start with “geo,” and they all also refer to spatial concepts. 
            In fact, if you look at these words’ etymologies, you can see that they all are all related to the Ancient Greek work, 
            γῆ (“geo”). Knowing this fact, you can probably guess that a lot of other words containing “geo” may have some shared 
            family history with those three words.
        </p>

    <h3>Etymological Relationships</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section1 text" id="text1">
            <p>
                In etymology, there are many different relationships that words can have to each other, even across languages, like in the example above. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, when two languages are spoken in the same place/community, speakers may eventually pick up words from each others’ languages to communicate. This relationship is called “borrowing.”</p>
            <p>
                Additionally, languages can change over time all on their own! (For example, the English pronoun “you” used to be plural, but now it is most often used as a singular.) With enough changes and enough time, this can even be considered a different language. “Inheritance” is the etymological relationship that describes words that pass directly through speakers of a language over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                More generally, if a word is related to a past word without a direct line of inheritance (for example, if it crossed over languages in the middle), this is called a “derived” relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the etymological relationships that we have looked at so far describe the way that words change over long periods of time, but we can also talk about relationships between contemporary words. For example, the modern English word, “cat,” and the modern Dutch word, “kat,” look/sound similar, and they both refer to small feline creatures with fur and whiskers. These words, which share form and meaning and have some shared history, are called “cognates.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Tracing a word’s etymology is like tracing the social and political history of its speakers - which is to say that it’s extremely complicated! There are many more etymological relationships, but for this project, we’ll focus on these 4 common relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this visualization specifically, we explore the many foreign languages that English has relationships with - you might be surprised how much of our language comes from other places!
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to use this visualization:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hover on each sub-bar to view more information about that relationship between English and the other languages in this etymology dataset.</li>
                <li>You can change the number of languages shown in the graph by typing/clicking the input box under the graph and clicking the “Submit” button.</li>

    <h3>Global Etymology</h3>

            <p>
                As we saw above, languages often interact with each other and change together over time. Language is a huge element of many people’s personal and national identity, 
                but your daily vocabulary may have a more diverse background than you realize. Of course, this is not just true for English - every language in the world has a deep 
                web of cultural exchanges linking it to words in other languages. Our histories cannot be neatly separated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this visualization, we’ll explore the many rich interactions between common modern languages in Europe. As you interact with the map, I encourage you to look 
                for patterns in the etymological relationships and the geographical/historical relationships between these countries. For example, you may notice that larger 
                empires have strong etymological relationships with many countries, and closer languages have stronger relationships to each other.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to use this visualization:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hover on each circle to view the language and country associated with that node.</li>
                <li>Click on a circle to view the etymological links between that language and the other ones on the map. 
                    Darker links indicate a stronger influence/relationship between the two languages.</li>
                <li>Click on a circle again to hide the links in/out of that node.</li>
                <li>Use your mouse to drag and zoom around the map.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>introduce idea that languages change and interact</li>
                <li>introduce idea of globalism</li>
                <li>instructions to read/use the plot</li>
                <li>How this plot adds to the story: 
                    This plot will directly demonstrate which languages English terms show the most etymological relationships with. 
                    This will demonstrate the global relationship between different languages and emphasize the main idea of my project - that languages are deeply connected.

    <h3>Etymology Exploration</h3>

            <p>
                Through the previous visualizations, we’ve learned a bit about etymology and explored the idea of cross-language interactions. 
                With this final visualization, I leave the data to you to explore! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this tool, you can explore the etymological relationships behind over 300,000 different English words.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to use this visualization:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Type a word into the input box and click "Submit" to see its etymological relationships.</li>
                <li>Your search word should show up in the middle of the plot space, surrounded by its etymological relationships.</li>
                <li>Select/deselect a language to view/hide the related words in that language (identified by color).</li>
                <li>Hover over a circle to see details about the word, its language, and its relationship to your search word.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Language is everywhere, all around us. It shapes the ways we interact with other people, the ways we view ourselves, 
            and the ways we interact with the world around us. In this project, we  got a brief introduction to the linguistic 
            field of etymology, and we saw how this niche academic field can bring us valuable insights about complex social 
            and historical dynamics. Language has always been deeply intertwined with personal and cultural identity, but 
            etymology reveals that language is always changing, and there is so much global history behind every word.
        </p>
        <p>
            More than anything, I hope this project has encouraged you to become a little more curious to learn about the dynamic history behind the words you use every day!
